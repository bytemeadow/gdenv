## Usage

Install a specific version of Godot using commands like:

```bash
gdenv install 4.4.1
gdenv install 4.5-beta1
gdenv install 3.6 --dotnet
gdenv install --latest
gdenv install --latest-prerelease
```

gdenv will download and install the version you asked for so that it's ready to use.

### `.godot-version`

We recommend creating a `.godot-version` file to explicitly declare the Godot version for your project:

```txt
4.4.1
```

Then run:
```bash
gdenv install  # Installs 4.2.1
gdenv use      # Switches to 4.2.1
```
